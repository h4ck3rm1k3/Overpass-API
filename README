TODO
Hours
- What to install on other distros.
- Localize manual.
Days
- Do bbox-query for ways (Clear meaning of inside, look at bbox_query.cc and query.cc)
- Other output formats (look at print.cc): PBF, HTML
- Transactionality (easiest on block level, work out tests, look at backend/file_blocks.h)
Weeks
- Make Forecast possible
- Rule processing
- Speed optimization, in particular for foreach, bbox_query and make_area
- interactive search engine
- changesets, versions and maybe user-ids
